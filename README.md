# Flight Recorder

Flight Recorder is an always-on audio logging system that continuously captures sound, detects novelty, and preserves meaningful moments while ignoring repetition.

Inspired by black boxes and neuromorphic systems, it acts as a passive memory aid for long creative sessions — listening quietly in the background without demanding interaction.

## Goals
- Always-on, low-friction audio capture
- Favor novelty over repetition
- Preserve moments worth revisiting
- Minimal user interaction
- Non-surveillance, creator-first design

## Non-goals
- Real-time monitoring
- Judgement or scoring of content
- Productivity tracking
- Cloud dependency (by default)

## Status
Early exploration / concept capture.
